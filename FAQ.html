      <div class="question">Q1: How can I register and what are the basic privileges?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        Users can create an account using <strong>Google</strong> or <strong>Apple</strong> for identity verification.  
        If you prefer, you can also use the app in <strong>Guest Mode</strong> without registration.  
        Some regions may be eligible for <strong>free access</strong> based on company policy, which is subject to change at any time.  
        Monthly subscribers will have their account progress and in-app coins preserved.  
        Free users, however, are not guaranteed to retain their data or coins.
